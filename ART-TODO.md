TODO for art assets
===================

Bugs
====

* All monsters need re-texturing
* Obelisks and broken pillars probably need new normals
	- Use Blender's edge split modifier
* Ambient light is too bright and models' ambient too low
* Fix low resolution textures
	- Scan with `identify assets/models/*/*.jpg assets/monsters/*/*.jpg | grep -v 1024 | grep -v thumb`


Wishlist
========

* More skyboxes
* More monsters!
	- Requirements:
		+ Preferably around 1000 vertices
		+ Good textures
		+ Animated
* Also more props
