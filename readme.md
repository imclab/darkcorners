Dungeon
=======

This is 3d first person game prototype.
The main design guideline is sacrificing artistic liberties for quickness of content creation.

This is based on several JS libraries, most prominently:

* Three.js - http://mrdoob.github.com/three.js/
	* Graphics engine
* Physijs - http://chandlerprall.github.com/Physijs/
	* Physics engine
* dat.GUI - http://code.google.com/p/dat-gui/
	* Settings GUI
