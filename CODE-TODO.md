TODO & Roadmap
==============

Core engine
-----------

* Campaign files
	- Levels
	- Default background music(s)
* Light properties from assets.js
	- Center the torch models
	- Auto place model based on bounding box
	- Particle effect config
	- Light placement offset config
	- Light color, range config
* Weapons from assets.js
	- Type (projectile, melee)
	- Model
	- Ammo type
	- Sound (shoot, reload, empty)
	- Offset from player
* Texture sharing between models
	- Mention texture path in assets.js
	- Expand to model sharing
* Individual wall texture to a block
* Object LOD?
	- Use simpler mesh for far away objects
	- Use simple materials for far away objects
* Level mesh LOD?
	- Divide to chunks for simplifying based on distance


Gameplay
--------

* Melee weapons
* Complex enemy AI
* Pick up objects, move and throw them
* Better character dynamics (so that object mass matters)


Editor
------

* Move things
* Clickable thumbnails
