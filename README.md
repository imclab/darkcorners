Dark Corners
============

This is 3d first person game prototype with a level editor.
The main design guideline is sacrificing artistic liberties for quickness of content creation.
See http://tapio.github.com/darkcorners/ for more information and demo.


System Requirements
-------------------

* Latest version of Chrome or Firefox
	* Chrome offers noticeable better performance
	* IE does not support WebGL and Opera has issues
* **Good dedicated GPU and drivers** (both must not be blacklisted for WebGL by the browser vendors)
* **Powerful CPU** so that JavaScript runs well
