Dungeon
=======

This is 3d first person game prototype with a level editor.
The main design guideline is sacrificing artistic liberties for quickness of content creation.


System Requirements
-------------------

* Latest version of Chrome or Firefox
	* Chrome offers noticeable better performance
	* IE does not support WebGL and Opera has issues
* Good dedicated GPU and drivers (both must not be blacklisted for WebGL by the browser vendors)
* Decent CPU so that JavaScript runs well


Acknowledgements
----------------

This is based on several JS libraries, most prominently:

* Three.js - http://mrdoob.github.com/three.js/
	* Graphics engine
* Physijs - http://chandlerprall.github.com/Physijs/
	* Physics engine
* Fireworks.js - http://jeromeetienne.github.com/fireworks.js/
	* Particle engine
* dat.GUI - http://code.google.com/p/dat-gui/
	* Settings and editor GUI

With art assets, Blendswap (http://www.blendswap.com/) and especially
Open Game Art (http://opengameart.org/) have been invaluable.
