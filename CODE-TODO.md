TODO & Roadmap
==============

Core engine
-----------

* Fix monster animation
* Texture sharing between models
	- Mention texture path in assets.js
	- Expand to model sharing
* Individual wall texture to a block
* Object LOD?
	- Use simpler mesh for far away objects
	- Use simple materials for far away objects
* Level mesh LOD?
	- Divide to chunks for simplifying based on distance


Gameplay
--------

* Complex enemy AI
* Pick up objects, move and throw them
* Better character dynamics (so that object mass matters)


Editor
------

* Move things
* Clickable thumbnails
